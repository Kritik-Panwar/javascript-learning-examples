    Nipun : BMI Calculator: Design a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator that takes user inputs for weight and height and calculates their BMI.
    User Interface:

    The BMI calculator should have a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their weight and height.
    The user interface can be a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) depending on your preference.
    Input Validation:

    The calculator should validate the user's input for weight and height to ensure they are positive numbers.
    If the user enters invalid input (e.g., negative numbers, non-numeric characters), the calculator should display an error message and prompt the user to re-enter the values.
    Calculation:

    The BMI should be calculated using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height)
    The weight should be entered in kilograms (kg), and the height should be entered in meters (m).
    BMI Categories:

    After calculating the BMI, the calculator should display the BMI value along with the corresponding BMI category to indicate the user's weight status. The categories are as follows:
    BMI < 18.5: Underweight
    18.5 <= BMI < 24.9: Normal weight
    25 <= BMI < 29.9: Overweight
    BMI >= 30: Obese
    Display:

    The calculator should display the user's BMI value and the associated BMI category.
    The BMI value should be rounded to two decimal places for better readability.
    Error Handling:

    The calculator should handle any potential errors gracefully and provide clear error messages to the user if necessary.
    User Experience:

    The BMI calculator should provide a user-friendly experience, guiding the user through the process and ensuring that the inputs are clear and understandable.
    Usability:

    The calculator should be easy to use, and the user should be able to rerun the calculation as many times as desired without having to restart the program.
    Programming Language:

    The BMI calculator can be implemented in any programming language of your choice. Common choices include Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, etc.
    Documentation:

    The code should be well-documented with comments to explain the logic and functionality of the BMI calculator.
    Optional Features (for enhancements):

    The calculator could include additional features, such as allowing users to choose between different unit systems (metric or imperial) for weight and height.
    It could also include a graphical representation of the BMI category (e.g., displaying a colored bar indicating the user's weight status).
